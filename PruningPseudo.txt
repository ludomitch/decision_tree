T_0 : Initial Tree
T_m : Root of the tree

example : we have 7 levels, and we wish to run pruning in the 3 penultimate levels

for depth level (i) in desired pruning levels (4,5,6)
	1 - Create Subtree (Left, Right) from parent tree
	3 - Subtree (L/R) that minimises: (where j is L/R and i is the depth level)
		alpha_(j) = (err(T_(i-1)_j,DataSet) - err(T_(i),DataSet)) / (number of leaves in T_(i) - number of leaves in T_(i-1)_j)
	4 - Is prioritised for removal.
	5 - Iterate for a chosen level, and remove the least information losing node (replacing it with the most occuring class)
